## Shoe Product Definition

The sample app also installs a product definition called "Shoe" which has two product definition fields "Awesomness" which is of the data type boolean and "ShortStory" which is of the data type short text.
This product definition is installed using [the initialization pipeline][1], which means that even though you delete the product definition it will be recreated everytime the application is starts up.
